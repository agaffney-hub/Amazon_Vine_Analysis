# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
In this project, I was tasked with finding how many helpful five-star reviews were given in a data set of Amazon books reviews. I was also analyzing how many reviews were paid for Vine reviews.


## Results: 
 - 2 reviews were Vine and paid
    - 1 (50%) of the Vine reviews was 5-stars
  
 - 2,325,442 reviews were unpaid
    - 1,467,537 (60%) reviews were unpaid and 5-stars

## Summary: 
Vine did have a positivity bias, but considering my results to pull from were only two reviews, it is inconclusive to say definitively.

One analysis I do believe that could be further investigated is the verified purchase column, in which we could see how many 5-star to 1-star reviews were left from the verified purchases, as this could also have a variation on what the average scores look like in a barchart similar to the one above.
